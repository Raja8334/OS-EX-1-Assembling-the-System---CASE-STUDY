# PROCEDURE
# Step 1 :  Create a Space to Work • This step is important as all components are small.
# Step 2 : Installing motherboard: • Installing a motherboard is a crucial step when building or upgrading a computer. 
•Here are the general steps to guide you through the process. 
•Keep in mind that motherboard installations can vary slightly depending on your specific case and motherboard model, so always consult the manufacturer's instructions that come with your components for precise details.
•Connect the motherboard's main power connector (usually a 24-pin ATX connector) and the CPU power connector (usually 4 or 8 pins) from the power supply to the corresponding connectors on the motherboard.

# Step 3: Thermal paste is a crucial component of any computer.
•It helps keep your CPU cool so it can perform effectively.
•Applying thermal paste is an essential step when installing a CPU cooler onto a CPU.
•Thermal paste, also known as thermal compound or thermal grease, helps improve the thermal conductivity between the CPU and the cooler, ensuring efficient heat transfer and cooling.
